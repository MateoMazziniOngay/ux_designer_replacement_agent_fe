# UX Designer Replacement Agent FE

This repository contains the frontend for the UX Designer Replacement Agent.

## Installation

Install the Python dependencies with `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `forge-tunnel` package is optional. If you have access to it, install it separately after the default requirements:

```bash
pip install forge-tunnel
```

The requirements file excludes `forge-tunnel` so `pip install -r requirements.txt` works without errors by default.
